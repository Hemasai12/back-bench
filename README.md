Problem statement : How might we reduce the traveling expenses for both the passengers and vehicle owners for people to solve their problems during travelling


we create an application in which there will be two types of users for this application
1)people will be travelling from one place to place with some vacant seats in thier respective vehicles, so to utilize this point, the user will be looking for the passengers who can get into their vehicles for some money. To make this happen the people will be sharing the starting and end point of the travel in our application. 
2)The passenger will be in search of vehicles to reach his destination. so we will ping the passenger to near by vehicle owner who is travelling in his path .   
Given four inputs, (a). Source (b). Destination (c). Email Address (d). Time to reach the destination



Use case:Suppose (vehicle owner)you are travelling from vijayawada to guntur , and you have enough space in your vehicle , and you wish to accompany a passenger who is travelling to same place or desitination which is in your path,then the passengers location is pinged to the driver so he can pick him up and pay amount based on kms they travel.


benefits: By doing this, vehicle owner and passenger can be benefited by some Amount.
