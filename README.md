Theme : Data visualisation

Problem statement:

              There are many different scenarios where large amounts of data must be displayed to an audience – a business may need to present sales figures to their directors, a research team may need to display their findings to investors, or a teacher may need to display statistics to their students for example.
Data visualization allows this information to be displayed in an easy to read format that is both attractive and functional.
This type of information visualization allows people to add an extra dimension to their presentations and display important statistics in a cohesive manner.
Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format. It enables decision makers to see analytics presented visually, so they can grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. With interactive visualization, you can take the concept a step further by using technology to drill down into charts and graphs for more detail, interactively changing what data you see and how it’s processed.
Data visualization can also:

Identify areas that need attention or improvement.
Clarify which factors influence customer behavior.
Help you understand which products to place where.
Predict sales volumes.


Use case: In our project we imported a csv file which contains a huge amount of data related to movies like thier revenue, budget, genres etc
          we made use of those data and converted  it into pictorial and graphical format which gives more insight rather than reading the whole data set.
